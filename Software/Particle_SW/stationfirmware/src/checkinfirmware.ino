/*********************************************************************
 * MNCheckin
 * 
 * This program is used to verify and checkin members to the Maker Nexus
 * makerspace. The program waits for a correctly formated Mifare RFID card
 * to be presented. Two values are read from the card: clientID and UID. 
 * The program verifies that the CRM system (EzFacility) has a contact with
 * clientID and that the contact record has UID associated with it. This 
 * validates the card and the contact. The program then determines if the 
 * contact has a valid, paid-up membership. If all tests are good a green
 * light and beep are presented. If not a red light and a long buzz are 
 * presented.
 * 
 * RFID Card Functions
 * This program integrates the Adafruit PN532
 * RFID brakout board with Particle (Photon).  The Particle device
 * is interfaced to the Adafruit breakout board using I2C.  Wiring
 * is as follows;
 * 
 *  Photon powered via USB
 *  PN532 breakout board 5.0V to Photon VIN
 *  PN532 breakout board GND to Photon GND (both GND)
 *  PN532 breakout board SDA to Photon D0
 *  PN532 breakout board SCL to Photon D1 
 *  Both SCL and SDA pulled up to Photon +3.3v using 5.6kohm resistors
 *  PN532 breakout board IRQ to Photon D3
 *  Photon D4 not connected but reserved for "RST"
 *  Breakout board jumpers are set for I2C:  SEL 1 is OFF and SEL 0 is ON
 * 
 * A 16x2 lcd display as also connected to the Photon.  LCD wiring is:
 *  lcd VSS to GND.  lcd VDD to +3.3 volts. lcd V0 to wiper of a 10K pot.  
 *    One end of the pot is connected to +3.3. volts and the other end to GND.
 *  lcd RS to Photon A0. lcd RW to GND. lcd EN to Photon A1. lcd D0 - D3 are left unconnected.
 *  lcd D4 to Photon A2.  lcd D5 to Photon A3.  lcd D6 to Photon D5.  lcd D7 to Photon D6.
 *  LCD A to +3.3 volts.  lcd K to GND.
 * 
 * 
 * The program initially waits 5 seconds so that a tty port can be connected for
 * serial console communication.  A "trying to connect ..." message is then
 * printed to the serial port to show that things are ready.  Next, the Photon
 * communicates with the breakout board to read out and print the PN532 firmware
 * version data to show that the Photon is talking to the breakout board.  
 * 
 * This program determines if an ISO14443A card presented to the reader is
 * factory fresh or if it has been formatted as Maker Nexus.  Based upon the
 * determined format, the firmware then changes keys to reverse the format;
 * i.e. make factory fresh to MN or make MN to factory fresh.  After changing
 * the card format, this firmware then writes some data to blocks 0 and 1
 * and reads them back, in order to verfy the key changes.  If the new format
 * is factory fresh, the data written to both blocks is 16 bytes of 0x00.  However,
 * if the new format is MN, the data written to blocks 0 and 1 is test data 
 * that is different for each block.  Thus, the firmware toggles the card
 * back and forth between MN format and factory default format with each 
 * placement and removal of the test card.
 * 
 * 
 * Adapted from code at:
 *   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532/blob/master/examples
 * 
 * Once the clientID and UID have been stored in g_clientInfo the program will 
 * move on to the next steps and mark the clientID record as "checked in" in
 * the CRM system (EzFacility).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CheckIn
 * 
 * The program uses Particle.io webhooks to 
 * access and update information in the EZFacility CRM database used
 * by Maker Nexus. Associated with this file is a file called webhooks.txt
 * that contains the JSON code needed to recreate each Particle.io
 * webhook used by this code. Once the webhooks have been created 
 * you will need to modify the webhook ezfGetCheckInToken to have a valid 
 * EZFacility authentication token and username/password.
 * 
 * There are several cloud functions so this program can be tested
 * through the Particle.io console.
 * 
 * The primary call-in is the cloud function RFIDCardRead. Call this
 * with a two value, comma separated string of the form
 *     clientID,UID
 * where clientID is a valid clientID and UID is expected to be found 
 * in the associated record in the EZFacility CRM database. An example is:
 *     21613660,rt56
 * Currently the UID is ignored in this code.
 * 
 * After calling RFIDCardRead, a series of debug events are published
 * for your convenience. When the process successfully completes you
 * can verify the action by going to the EZFacility Admin console and 
 * running the report Check-in Details.
 * 
 * 
 * PRE RELEASE DEVELOPMENT LOG
 * 
 * (c) 2019; Team Practical Projects
 * 
 * Authors: Bob Glicksman, Jim Schrempp
 * 
 *  This is a list of functionality that we want to make sure is in the documentation 
 *      Cloud function SetDeviceType must be called to set up machine. Values are in eDeviceConfigType
 *      Device Type is shown on LCD at end of setup.  
 *      Version string now shows on LCD at end of setup()
 *      prefixed cloud functions with "cloud"
 *      client checkin now validates UID in card against EZF and checks contract status and amount due.
 *      JSON returned to Admin on "card info" now includes "Checkin" which tells what would happen if the
 *                card was used at a checkin terminal
 *      logToDB() which writes to a webhook, the webhook sends data to a url for logging
 *      Admin identifyCard now times out if card not presented in 15 seconds
 *      Set timezone and DST in setup() for use in logToDB()
 *      returned JSON and made Checkin msg "billing issue"
 *      added FirstName to logToDB for display use
 *      identify card now detects previous MN format
 *      resetCard will now make an MN card "factory fresh"
 *      moved all webhook callbacks to one routine
 *      LCD shows checked in or out based on our database
 *      second callback routine for mnlogdb... webhooks
 * 

 * 
 *  1.20 supports device type 4 woodshop door 
 *       device type -1 will buzz once. use this to know you're talking to the right box
 *       Fixed issue #15 where bad cards got denied and ok messages
 *       Fixed woodshop using old package data
 *  1.30 readTheCard now tests for block read failure and reports to user on LCD
 *       readTheCard restructured to minimize time card must be presented
 *  1.40 deployed into production
 *  1.41 added ShopBot to allowed woodshop packages
 *  1.42 has new packages code that relies on mustache template to be used at the webhook
 *  1.5  reads station config from Facility Database. Does not yet use the info.
 *  1.6  added last name to fdb logging
 *  1.61 removed enum for dev type, instead relying on fdb for configuration info
 *  1.7  published a checkin event on successful checkin. useful for lockbox
 *  1.71 includes check of RFID revocation on equipment station checkin 
 *  1.72 blinks admit led when RFID card is successfully read 
 *  1.73 new build with PRODUCTION switch in mnutils.h
 *  1.8  ezfReceiveClientByClientID has been reworked to handle the case where the response is more than one 
 *       part from Particle Cloud and the parts come out of order.
 *  1.9  added DEBUGX_EVENTS_ALLOWED define in mnutils.h to disable publishing debugX events in production
 *       the checked in code should have this define commented out. Also, runs on Particle 3.0
 *  2.0  Looking into github bug #79. added a few comments and removed call to ezfcheckin in the
 *       loopCheckin function state machine. We don't know if this will fix the bug.
 *  2.1  updated to new ArduinoJSON library version 6.18.4
 *       replaced .as<char*>() with .as<const char*>()
 *  2.2  Waiting on clientByClientID now sets an error if the first deserialize fails. With Mustache 
 *       code in the Particle Cloud webhook, we should only get one message back, so no need to wait.
 *       Adds logging of webhook response if deserialize fails.
 *  2.3  Now does not keep trying to get token if the previous getToken failed. This keeps us 
 *       from hammering the CRM system. Requires an update to ezfCheckinToken webhook that
 *       sets the Error-Response-Topic. After an error will try to get new token only when 
 *       an RFID card is presented.
 *  2.4  Corrected reporting to FDB on JSON parsing error
